      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer with a focus on full-stack web development.
        With a skill set spanning front-end and back-end technologies, I bring a
        creative, problem-solving approach to building intuitive, responsive,
        and high-performance web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background in game development has refined my abilities in
        interactive design, optimisation, and user experience, all of which I
        integrate into my projects to create dynamic and engaging applications.
