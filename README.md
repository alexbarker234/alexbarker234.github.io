## Deployment
- Uses GitHub actions to
  - Compile the subprojects with `npm run build` and then delete the source to not confuse Jekyll
  - Deploy with Jekyll

## Why switch away from git submodules?
Submodules always point to one commit, so updating them requires a commit instead of just redeploying.

Check out the old version using submodules in the [with-submodules](https://github.com/alexbarker234/alexbarker234.github.io/tree/with-submodules) branch
