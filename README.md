## Deployment
- Uses GitHub actions to
  - Compile the subprojects & other GitHub repo projects with `npm run build` 
  - Delete project source to not confuse Jekyll
  - Deploy with Jekyll

- Other GitHub repos are also configured to deploy to different pages subdirectories too

  - [snowbound](https://github.com/alexbarker234/snowbound) - [lexalot.dev/snowbound](https://lexalot.dev/snowbound)

- Note: I wanted some projects to have custom directories so didn't use GitHub page's project sites for these (e.g. /csmarks instead of /csmarks-redesign)
