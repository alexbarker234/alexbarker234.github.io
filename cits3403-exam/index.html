It enables developers to work with database tables as if they were Python classes, making it easier to query and manipulate data.
                        <br><br>
                        ORM frameworks like SQLAlchemy provide a way to synchronize Python classes with database tables by mapping the attributes and relationships of the classes to the columns and relationships of the tables. 
                        <br><br>
                        For example, in Songversation, there is a Python class "User" with attributes "user_id", "display_name" which correspond to columns in the database. This allowed interacting with the database through Python code, performing CRUD operations while abstracting direct SQL queries and protecting against SQL Injection
                        
                        I used SQLAlchemy to define a Python class called "User" that represents a table in the database. I defined attributes like "id", "name", and "email" in the class, and SQLAlchemy automatically created corresponding columns in the database table. This synchronization allows me to interact with the "User" table using Python code, performing operations like creating new users, querying existing users, or updating user information, all while abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and database interactions.`,

                Songversation is a game that allows users to log in with their Spotify account, choose a playlist or followed artist, and guess the correct song
                from three presented lyrics. Points are earned for each correct guess, and the game continues until an incorrect guess is made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our website is designed for music lovers who enjoy exploring various genres, artists, and songs. These individuals likely have an active Spotify
                account and actively curate playlists or follow their favorite artists.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game offers an entertaining way for users to test their knowledge of songs in their Spotify library. It adds a competitive element as
                players aim for a high score by correctly guessing as many songs as possible. Unlike Heardle or Lyricle, it provides a personalized experience
                based on the user's own music collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Songversation is built using Flask, using the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">Spotify API</a>. By leveraging the
                user's logged-in Spotify data, Songversation allows users to choose from playlists and artists that they follow. Songversation also makes use of
                the Spotify API to get all the songs belonging to an artist or playlist and then get their lyrics to send to the client to display on their page
                in the game, as well as cache the lyrics in our own database to speed up loading time for users.

                        In the lyric guessing mode, players can select a playlist or artist just like in the existing song guessing mode. However, instead of
                        guessing the song, the website presents players with a line of lyrics from a song. Their task is to enter the next line accurately. The
                        website then assesses their response, providing feedback on correctness. The game progresses with new lines of lyrics until the player
                        finishes the song or they guess wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>This mode adds depth and challenge by testing players' knowledge of lyrics, going beyond simply guessing the songs.</p>

                                VS Code is a code editor that provides excellent support for Python development. It offers features like syntax highlighting,
                                code completion, debugging, and integration with version control systems.

                                To incorporate this into the project, download VS Code and then open the cloned directory. VS Code should handle the file
                                system, running from the terminal and manage Git all in the same application, streamlining the developer experience.

                                Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your codebase and collaborate with other developers. It allows

                                Songversation is currently set up on GitHub, so to incorporate Git & GitHub into the project, install git. The existing
                                repository is already pre-configured. VS Code will also make using Git & GitHub very easy as it has built in functionality.

                                Postman is a tool for testing and documenting APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests, inspect responses, and create automated

                                Postman will be incredibly useful in testing Songversation's API routes, as well as Spotify's API routes. During development, we
                                used Postman to create sequences of API calls to ensure that the user can go from logging in, to getting lyrics for a track. We
                                also tested Songversations API routes to ensure that Spotify Authentication was working and our application was returning the

                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <h4>Meetings</h4>
                <p>
                    Ensure that regular weekly meetings are organised. If not all project members can make the meeting, consider rescheduling or allowing them
                    to join online. It is important for all members to be updated on progress, what they should be doing and how other members are going
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the development of Songversation, we had weekly in person meetings on Tuesdays where we would check up on how each of the assigned
                    tasks are progressing, and make sure no team member had any blockers that stopped them from doing work. We also communicated over text
                    whenever we needed something to ensure that information flow between our group members was quick, easy and efficient and not waiting for a
                    meeting. This allowed us to progress with the project at rapid speeds.

                <h3>Prioritisation</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to prioritising deadlines and deliverables, especially in situations where team members have competing deadlines from other
                    units, it is essential to establish best practices to ensure efficient workflow and successful project completion. Here are some guidelines
                    to consider:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <div class="list-item">
                        <li>Clearly Define Goals and Identify Minimum Viable Product:</li>
                        <p>
                            Begin by establishing a clear understanding of the project's goals and objectives. This will help prioritise tasks based on their
                            importance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evaluate what your minimum viable product (MVP) is. Determine the key deliverables that are essential for the project, and work to
                            accomplish the MVP before working on more features.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the development of Songversation, the main requirement was to have a functional website that took in a users text input, and
                            returned a response. From this requirement, we identified our MVP as "A webpage where the user can log in with Spotify, choose a
                            playlist and guess which song the lyrics are from". This allowed us to quickly work towards a working product that met the
                            requirements of the project before moving on to the more nice to have features.
                        </p>

                        <li>Evaluate Dependencies and Constraints:</li>
                        <p>
                            Assess the dependencies and constraints associated with each task or deliverable. Identify any tasks that rely on the completion of
                            other tasks or require specific resources or expertise. This evaluation will help determine the order in which tasks should be
                            prioritised.

                            Divide complex deliverables into smaller, manageable tasks. Assign deadlines to each task, considering factors like complexity,
                            effort required, and dependencies. This breakdown enables better tracking of progress and allows for a more efficient allocation of
                            resources.

                            If team members have competing deadlines from other units, it may be necessary to negotiate and adjust deadlines to ensure a fair
                            distribution of workload. Ensure that any adjustments are communicated clearly and fairly. This came up frequently in the
                            Songversation Project with one of our members doing 4 assignments at once. Any dependancies they were working on had to be carefully
                            evaluated and sometimes passed to more available group members so other group members can move on with the tasks.

                            Encourage open communication within the team to understand each team member's workload and competing deadlines. Ensure frequent
                            meetings where team members can share their progress, challenges, and potential conflicts to ensure everyone is on the same page.
